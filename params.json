  "body": "_\"Don't Leave Home Without It\"_\r\n\r\nThe TSATool was designed as a handy way to store and use 3D printed reproductions of the most common TSA master keys\r\n(currently TSA002 & TSA007). One of the biggest usability issues with 3D printed keys is how fragile they are, so the\r\nprimary goal when designing the TSATool was making sure that the keys themselves wouldn't be bent or otherwise damaged in\r\nthe user's pocket or tool bag.\r\n\r\nBill of Materials\r\n========\r\n\r\nAside from the printed parts, assembling the TSATool requires the following:\r\n\r\n* M4X15mm Cap Screws (x2)\r\n* M4 Washers (x8)\r\n* M4 Nut (x2)\r\n\r\nAll of these parts can be sourced from Home Depot for a grand total of about $4, and much cheaper if you're in a part of\r\nthe world where metric hardware isn't considered an exotic delicacy.\r\n\r\nIn addition, you can skip the M4 washers if you print two copies of *\"tsa_tool_spacer.stl\"*, though the action is much smoother with the metal washers.\r\n\r\nProject Lineage\r\n=========\r\n\r\nWhile the housing is a completely new design, the keys themselves are modified from the [TSA-Travel-Sentry-master-keys\r\n](https://github.com/Xyl2k/TSA-Travel-Sentry-master-keys) project. The 3D models of these keys were originally released as a\r\nproof of concept by [Steven Knuchel (Xylitol)](http://www.xylibox.com/), which I then refined into workable keys by\r\nexperimentation and with input from a number of testers.\r\n\r\nAs the TSATool is a derivative work of the *\"TSA-Travel-Sentry-master-keys\"* project, it inherits the Creative Commons\r\nAttribution-NonCommercial 3.0 license; this means the TSATool **CANNOT** be sold or otherwise used for the sole purpose of\r\nmaking a profit.\r\n\r\n\r\nLICENSE\r\n=========\r\nThis project is released under the Creative Commons Attribution-NonCommercial 3.0 Unported License.\r\n\r\n![](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/9/99/Cc-by-nc_icon.svg)\r\n\r\nYou are free to:\r\n\r\n* Share — copy and redistribute the material in any medium or format\r\n* Adapt — remix, transform, and build upon the material\r\n* The licensor cannot revoke these freedoms as long as you follow the license terms.\r\n\r\nUnder the following terms:\r\n\r\n* [!]Attribution — You must give appropriate credit to all contributors to this project, provide a link to the license, and indicate if changes were made.
