### _"Don't Leave Home Without It"_

The TSATool was designed as a handy way to store and use 3D printed reproductions of the most common TSA master keys
(currently TSA002 & TSA007). One of the biggest usability issues with 3D printed keys is how fragile they are, so the
primary goal when designing the TSATool was making sure that the keys themselves wouldn't be bent or otherwise damaged in
the user's pocket or tool bag.

Bill of Materials
========

Aside from the printed parts, assembling the TSATool requires the following:

* M4X15mm Cap Screws (x2)
* M4 Washers (x8)
* M4 Nut (x2)

All of these parts can be sourced from Home Depot for a grand total of about $4, and much cheaper if you're in a part of
the world where metric hardware isn't considered an exotic delicacy.

_Note:_ You can skip using the M4 washers if you print two copies of *"optional_spacer.stl"*, though the action is much
smoother with the metal washers.

Assembly
========

Assembling the TSATool is very simple. After printing all of the parts, snap the two M4 nuts into the hexagonal sockets on
both the front and back sides of the tool, then thread the M4 screws into their respective sockets. When the screws are
pushed through the plastic, add one washer, the printed key, and then finally three more washers.

This exploded render shows how each side is to be put together:

Once both sides have the washers and keys installed, you need to line them up and screw them together. I find this is
easiest to do one side at a time, making sure to only insert the screw on the side you start with only a few turns so you'll
be able to rotate the sides around so the other screw lines up.

Project Lineage
=========

While the housing is a completely new design, the keys themselves are modified from the [TSA-Travel-Sentry-master-keys
](https://github.com/Xyl2k/TSA-Travel-Sentry-master-keys) project. The 3D models of these keys were originally released as a
proof of concept by [Steven Knuchel (Xylitol)](http://www.xylibox.com/), which I then refined into workable keys with input
from a number of testers and through experimentation.
