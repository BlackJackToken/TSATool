TSATool
=========

### "Don't Leave Home Without It"

The TSATool was designed as a handy way to store and use 3D printed reproductions of the most common TSA master keys
(currently TSA002 & TSA007). One of the biggest usability issues with 3D printed keys is how fragile they are, so the
primary goal when designing the TSATool was making sure that the keys themselves wouldn't be bent or otherwise damaged in
the user's pocket or tool bag.

Bill of Materials
========

Aside from the printed parts, assembling the TSATool requires the following:

* M4X15mm Cap Screws (x2)
* M4 Washers (x8)
* M4 Nut (x2)

All of these parts can be sourced from Home Depot for a grand total of about $4, and much cheaper if you're in a part of
the world where metric hardware isn't considered an exotic delicacy.

In addition, you can skip the M4 washers if you print two copies of *"tsa_tool_spacer.stl"*, though the action is much smoother with the metal washers.

Project Lineage
=========

While the housing is a completely new design, the keys themselves are modified from the [TSA-Travel-Sentry-master-keys
](https://github.com/Xyl2k/TSA-Travel-Sentry-master-keys) project. The 3D models of these keys were originally released as a
proof of concept by [Steven Knuchel (Xylitol)](http://www.xylibox.com/), which I then refined into workable keys by
experimentation and with input from a number of testers.
